  Though my presidential oath in the picture is a bit childish, I'm as mature as they come, when it comes to app development. I've led my own mobile app teams to create gems like 'Movie Mate' which boasts over 850,000 movie and 2 million actor records. \n
  Innovatively, I've also blended print and digital through my artifical newspapers, turning static articles into dynamic videos in renowned publications like Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.\n
  Between coding and creativity, if there's an app challenge, it's either on my radar or it has been tackled, and don't just take my word for it. Check my resume, projects, etc. See for yourself! \n
